Path planning means that the vehicle plan its own path aiming to get the shortest one and avoiding obstacles in it. This can be done by two type of algorithms:

- [Grid based algorithms](https://github.com/HendEmad/Image-Processing-projects/tree/main/Basics/Path%20Planning/Grid%20based%20algorithms)
- [Random based algorithms](https://github.com/HendEmad/Image-Processing-projects/tree/main/Basics/Path%20Planning/Random%20Sampling%20based%20algorithms)
